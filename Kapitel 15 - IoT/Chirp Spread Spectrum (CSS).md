> In digital communications, **Chirp Spread Spectrum** (CSS) is a spread spectrum technique that uses wideband linear frequency modulated chirp pulses to encode information.  A chirp is a sinusoidal signal whose frequency increases or decreases over time (often with a polynomial expression for the relationship between time and frequency).
