> The 3rd Generation Partnership Project (**3GPP**) is an umbrella term for a number of standards organizations which develop protocols for mobile telecommunications. Its best known work is the development and maintenance of:
>
> GSM and related 2G and 2.5G standards, including GPRS and EDGE
>
> UMTS and related 3G standards, including HSPA and HSPA+
>
> LTE and related 4G standards, including LTE Advanced and LTE Advanced Pro
>
> 5G NR and related 5G standards, including 5G-Advanced
>
> An evolved IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) developed in an access independent manner3GPP is a consortium with seven national or regional telecommunication standards organizations as primary members ("organizational partners") and a variety of other organizations as associate members ("market representation partners"). The 3GPP organizes its work into three different streams: Radio Access Networks, Services and Systems Aspects, and Core Network and Terminals.The project was established in December 1998 with the goal of developing a specification for a 3G mobile phone system based on the 2G GSM system, within the scope of the International Telecommunication Union's International Mobile Telecommunications-2000, hence the name 3GPP. It should not be confused with 3rd Generation Partnership Project 2 (3GPP2), which developed a competing 3G system, CDMA2000.The 3GPP administrative support team (known as the "Mobile Competence Centre") is located at the European Telecommunications Standards Institute headquarters in the Sophia Antipolis technology park in France.
